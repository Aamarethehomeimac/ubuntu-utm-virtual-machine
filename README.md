# Ubuntu UTM Virtual Machine for macOS

**WARNING:** This guide was only tested with UTM. Attempting to use it on real metal could cause system damage, especially if you lack the necessary computer knowledge. The creator of this guide is not responsible for any damage caused by reckless use. If damage occurs, you are solely responsible for purchasing a new computer. If you damage your system, the cheapest Macbook as of Decmeber 2024 is the Mackbook Air M3 for $1099. Even the cheapest is VERY expensive, So better to sue UTM if you dont have upwards 1000 dollars.
**To set up the virtual machine, you’ll need:**

- A Mac M1, M2, M3, M4 (PRO and ULTRA models are also supported).
- UTM: Download it from https://mac.getutm.app/.
- Ubuntu Server ARM: Download it from https://ubuntu.com/download/server/arm.
- Approximately 20GB of free space is recommended.

**Note:** If you have a recovery macOS (TM) USB, you can use Ubuntu on bare metal.
